labels: {}                           # merged into Deployment/Service metadata; useful for selectors/monitoring
podLabels: {}                        # applied only to Pod metadata (use when selectors or tooling target pods directly)
annotations: {}                      # resource-level annotations (e.g., for ingress, backups)
podAnnotations: {}                   # pod-level annotations (e.g., sidecar injection hints)

service:
  # Use `service.spec` as the single source of truth for Service configuration.
  # This chart will render `service.spec` directly under `spec:` in the Service
  # resource. Define any keys here that you would want to appear in the Service
  # manifest (type, ports, externalTrafficPolicy, loadBalancerIP, sessionAffinity, etc).
  #
  # Examples and sane defaults:
  annotations: {}
  spec:
    # Service type: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName
    type: ClusterIP

    # Optional cluster/size-specific configuration:
    # loadBalancerIP: ""            # static IP for LoadBalancer services
    # clusterIP: ""                 # set a specific ClusterIP, or "" to use cluster default
    # ipFamily: IPv4                # IPv4 or IPv6
    # externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
    # sessionAffinity: None         # or ClientIP

    # Ports list. Define name, protocol, port and targetPort (or omit targetPort to
    # use the same value as port). The template will render these under `ports:`.
    ports:
      - name: webservice
        protocol: TCP
        port: 8069
        targetPort: 8069
      - name: polling
        protocol: TCP
        port: 8072
        targetPort: 8072

    # If you need nodePort(s) for NodePort services, include them here:
    # ports:
    #   - name: webservice
    #     protocol: TCP
    #     port: 8069
    #     targetPort: 8069
    #     nodePort: 30080

    # Any additional top-level Service.spec keys can be defined here. They will be
    # rendered verbatim into the Service resource.
    #
    # Example of health/annotation keys you might want to set:
    # healthCheckNodePort: 32000

storage:
  # mounts: list of PVC mounts created/used by the chart (pvcs.yaml)
  #  - name: data
  #    enabled: true                   # when false, this PVC is disabled
  #    existingClaim: ""               # provide an existing PVC name to USE instead of creating one
  #    storageClass: ""                # leave empty to use cluster default StorageClass
  #    accessMode: ReadWriteOnce       
  #    path: "/volumes/data"
  #    size: the size of the PVC to create (e.g., 10Gi)
  mounts:
    - name: data
      enabled: true
      path: "/volumes/data"
      size: 10Gi
    - name: addons
      enabled: false
